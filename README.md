AIY Project Scripts

Some scripts I created that can be used with the AIY Voice Kit v1 (https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/voice-v1/)

1. DanceParty.py - plays a DJ Horn when the button is pressed.
2. cloudspeech_demo.py - Uses google cloud voice api to interpret voice and run commands. Also queries database.
